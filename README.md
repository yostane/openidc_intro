# Open ID Connect

When we develop web or mobile or apps, we may deal with the authentication of the users. Handling authentication on our own backend can prove complicated and degrous because we are responible of handling sensible data. Hopefully, there is a way to delegate authentication to an authentication server and is called OpenID Conncet. This On top of that, it is a standard protocol that is well suited for mobile apps and web apps. This post serves as a modest introcution to this standard.

## Introduction

OpenID Connect, abbreviated OIDC, is a standard that allows to a program, application or website to identify a user thanks to an authentication server. It also allows to get basic authentication iformation.

OIDC does not define new protocols from scratch for every aspectof the identification. Instead, it relies on OAuth 2, which is a framwork that defines how a user can get access to ressources, and adds a layer that allows to identify the user nad a to provide basic information about him.

(Identity, Authentication) + OAuth 2.0 = OpenID Connect
